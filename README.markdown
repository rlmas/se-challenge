# Wave Software Development Challenge - Submission
The following submission meets the requirement of creating a simple upload client that allows a user to upload a CSV file containing a dataset with predetermined headers in a particular order. What makes me pround of this application are the fact that, on the front end, it's: 
1. Cross-browser
1. Responsive
1. Balanced and simple in design
1. Takes advantage of mainstream libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Web Fonts)
1. Works even if JS is disabled
1. Readable even if CSS is disabled

And on the back end, it's:
1. Function oriented
1. Organized
1. Clean and easy to debug
1. Easy to expand in scope
    
Really, to summarize, what I'm most happy with is the fact that it's usable, clean and it works.     

Thanks for the challenge,
Ryan
