# Wave Software Development Challenge - Submission
The following submission meets the requirement of creating a simple upload client that allows a user to upload a CSV file containing a dataset with predetermined headers in a particular order. What makes me pround of this application are the fact that, on the front end, it's: 
* Cross-browser
* Responsive
* Balanced and simple in design
* Takes advantage of mainstream libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Web Fonts)
* Works even if JS is disabled
* Readable even if CSS is disabled

And on the back end, it's:
* Function oriented
* Organized
* Clean and easy to debug
* Easy to expand in scope
    
Really, to summarize, what I'm most happy with is the fact that it's usable, clean and it works.     

Thanks for the challenge,
Ryan
